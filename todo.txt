version 0.10
============

showstopper: Nim does not boot with --threads:on!
- make nimble part of the distribution
- implement 'procCall'
- split idetools into separate tool
- split docgen into separate tool


Concurrency
-----------

- test 'deepCopy' for closures
- implement 'foo[1..4] = spawn(f[4..7])'

Low priority:
- support for exception propagation? (hard to implement)
- the copying of the 'ref Promise' into the thead local storage only
  happens to work due to the write barrier's implementation


Misc
----

- make '--implicitStatic:on' the default
- make tuple unpacking work in a non-var/let context
- special rule for ``[]=``, items, pairs
- built-in 'getImpl'
- prevent 'alloc(TypeWithGCedMemory)'
- some table related tests are wrong (memory usage checks)


Bugs
====

- fix the bug that keeps 'defer' template from working
- VM: Pegs do not work at compile-time
- VM: ptr/ref T cannot work in general
- scopes are still broken for generic instantiation!
- bug: type conversions concerning proc types are weird
- compilation of niminst takes way too long. looks like a regression
- docgen: sometimes effects are listed twice
- blocks can "export" an identifier but the CCG generates {} for them ...


version 0.9.x
=============

- implicit deref for parameter matching; but only for  x.f(a, b) --> looks like
  a nice compromise
- overloading of '='
- allow simple read accesses to global variables --> difficult to ensure that
  no data races happen
- pragmas need 'bindSym' support
- pragmas need re-work: 'push' is dangerous, 'hasPragma' does not work
  reliably with user-defined pragmas
- memory manager: add a measure of fragmentation
- implement 'bits' pragmas
- we need a magic thisModule symbol
- ensure (ref T)(a, b) works as a type conversion and type constructor
- optimize 'genericReset'; 'newException' leads to code bloat


version 0.9.X
=============

- macros as type pragmas
- implement type API for macros
- lazy overloading resolution:
  * special case ``tyStmt``
- document NimMain and check whether it works for threading

GC
==

- hybrid GC
- use big blocks in the allocator
- provide tool/API to track leaks/object counts
- resizing of strings/sequences could take into account the memory that
  is allocated


CGEN
====
- codegen should use "NIM_CAST" macro and respect aliasing rules for GCC
- ``restrict`` pragma + backend support
- 'const' objects including case objects
